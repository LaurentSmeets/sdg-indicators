## 1. What are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
In 2015, all member states of the United Nations signed up to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. They set measurable aims for improving our world. Each goal covers a different aspect of life: poverty, hunger, education, equality, the environment, justice, economy and so on. They all have targets and indicators we aim to achieve by 2030.

The United Nations will collect and catalogue data from each country to monitor progress towards achieving the goals. A central principle of the goals is to make sure we “Leave No-one Behind”. With that in mind, all the reported data must be disaggregated by sex, age, geography, race, ethnicity, disability, migratory status and income, where applicable.

In the UK, Office for National Statistics (ONS) is responsible for reporting the country’s data to the United Nations. We will:

* source the appropriate UK data for the global indicators

* provide data to the international organisations responsible for each indicator, known as Custodian Agencies, who will report them to the United Nations

* analyse the data so that we can put it into context

* make the data available to everybody using an online tool and supporting reports
