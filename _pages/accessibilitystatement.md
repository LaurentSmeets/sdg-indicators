## Accessibility accreditation

We’re working to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. The site
currently meets the [‘AA’ level standard](http://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/index.php/office-for-
national-statistics-sdg) of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG
2.0)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag-20).
However, we’re aware of some issues and are working to fix these in order to meet ‘AAA’ standard.

## Known issues

Keyboard-only users must use the table view instead of the chart or interactive map to display data, and
Internet Explorer users may encounter problems in sorting/filtering the tables. An alternative is
provided – simply open the data in Excel using the ‘Download Source CSV’ button below the table.

## Compatibility with tools

This website should be compatible with recent versions of the following screen readers:

* Jaws (Windows)
* NVDA (Windows)
* ZoomText (Windows)
* VoiceOver (iPhone; MacOS)

The site should also be compatible with:

* Basic operating system screen magnifiers
